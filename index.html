<p>I’m a designer with skills in digital photography,  print design, and editorial,  with a background in illustration and fine art. </p>
<p>On the side, I am also sharpening my dexterity in front-end web design,  after school I plan on continuing my education in French and maybe even (finally) wind down to adopt a pooch.</p>
<p>I have a BFA in Graphic Design from Montserrat College of Art near Boston, but my origin story begins in Tampa.  In 2018 I interned with a local in-house design studio called Steez Design.</p>
<p>When I’m not creating,  I am out hiking,  enjoying an iced coffee,  or scouring thrift stores in search of more obnoxious windbreakers to add to my collection. </p>
